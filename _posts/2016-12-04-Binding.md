One of the most fascinating features of human perception (and one that still sets us firmly apart from artificial intelligence) is our superb ability to **group things together**.
We naturally perceive the world as being made of objects, their relationships and individual features. 
Indeed this **perceptual grouping** happens so effortless, that it is easy to miss altogether.
In my opinion, though, it is one of the biggest missing puzzle pieces on our way to general artificial intelligence.
Unfortunately few people seem to care or be aware of it.
So in this post, I'll try to convince you of the magnificence and importance of the general underlying ability - which I refer to as **binding**.
It will be a post full of pictures with visual illusions, most of which you've probably already seen many times.
But hopefully I will manage to give them a slightly different twist.

## Perceptual Grouping
So let us start by first exploring this ability of perceptual grouping in the visual domain. 
Later we'll see that it applies also to other senses, across them and even to abstract mental processes.
But first, take a look at this picture:

![cat on a stove](/images/cat_on_stove.jpg "Logo Title Text 1")


It is *easy* to see a cat in a frying pan on top of a stove surrounded by some other objects.
Now you might think: "Sure. So what? This is obvious!". 
But let us take a moment to appreciate how amazing this feat is that you've just performed in less than a second:
You have not only recognized multiple objects, but also *segmented* the image and inferred how these objects occlude each other.
Each object comes with a rich mental representation and several conscious and unconscious associations. 
The cat for example has obvious features such as being black, furry, and sitting.
But you also know that it is looking at you and might worry that it is [plotting to kill you](http://theoatmeal.com/misc/frame/cat_kill).
The teapot on the other hand is clearly smooth, glossy and reflective. 

### Iterative
* adjusts to difficulty
![horses](/images/horses.jpg "Logo Title Text 1")
* even more difficult
![dalmatian](/images/dalmatian_fig2.gif)
* interestingly we seem to remember something about the grouping
* should you ever encounter this image again you'll be much faster

### Amodal Perception
The horse picture is actually also a good example of amodal perception.
* amodal perception

### More cool Properties
* ambiguous / task-dependent (e.g. shadow and reflection)
* hierarchical (counting people vs. counting eyes)
* actually non-hierarchical (different groupings can overlap) 

### Gestalt Principles
* Note that this is not restricted to known objects (greebles).
* gestalt principles
* learned unsupervised
* Have been studied by psychologists in early 1900.
* Several Gestalt Principles: [scholarpedia](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Gestalt_principles)
    * Figure-Ground Articulation
    * Proximity
    * Common fate
    * similarity 
    * Continuity
    * Closure
    * Good Gestalt (Pr√§gnanz)
    * past experience
    * symmetry
    * convexity
    * common region
    * element connectedness


### Attention
Knowledge of some objects can help in recognizing others.
This sets the grouping apart from attention, which only focuses and thereby ignores information.

### Other Modalities
* this grouping doesn't just happen in vision
* cocktail party problem
* touch
* cross-modal


### Context Dependent Feature Binding
The high level features that are bound to a stimulus are dependent on the interpretation.
Most basic example is the Necker Cube:

![Necker Cube](/images/necker_cube.png)
But also 
![Shade](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Grey_square_optical_illusion.PNG)
More examples include the [colored cube](http://brainden.com/images/color-cube.jpg), and the [infamous dress](https://www.wired.com/2015/02/science-one-agrees-color-dress/).
And illusions like the [face/vase](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TeTrR8QtXKE/maxresdefault.jpg) and the [old/young lady](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_IBVPgalgRAk/S-g2Q95yAxI/AAAAAAAABMY/zCaXFbXyF4o/s1600/old+lady+young+optical+illusion.jpg).





### Comparison to Computer Vision
To put this into perspective, let us briefly look at the capabilities of current artificial vision systems.
Neural networks had a huge comeback and have come a long way in their ability to classify images.
For some settings they have already surpassed humans (cite Ciresan) and even for unconstrained real images, their performance is on par with human performance (check for comparison of imageNet with humans).
But when it comes to tracing their predictions back to the pixel level, the results are far behind (visualizing convnets).
There are systems trained for segmentation, but their performance is significantly worse than humans.
Furthermore it is good to keep in mind that they are mostly trained in a supervised fashion and with a small, fixed amount of class labels.
Consequently they often have trouble with instance segmentation. 


## The Binding Problem
* We've already seen that this ability for grouping includes many senses
* More generally it also involves all features, even abstract ones.
* even without visual input (e.g. black apple and green banana -- you can keep these separately in mind eventhough black is more common for a banana and green more common for an apple)
* binding problem
* when using distributed and disentangled features (and we want to), then ambiguity can arise
* so there has to be a mechanism
